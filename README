Scripts to build na install INDI and KStars

First clone this repository with command `git clone https://gitea.nouspiro.space/nou/astro-soft-build.git`
Later when there is update you can run `git pull origin` to get latest version of script.

Before first build install dependencies run `./install-dependencies.sh` to install all libraries needed to build.
This need to be run only once.
Then run `./build-soft-stable.sh` or `./build-soft-latest.sh`

By default it clone sources to $HOME/astro-soft or $HOME/astro-soft-stable directory. You can change that by setting
BUILD_DIR variable before. For example `BUILD_DIR="/home/username/I want to build here" ./build-soft-stable.sh`

Stable install last stable version and it is recomended to use. Latest will build bleeding edge version from repository
which sometimes can fail to build or can be unstable.

Beware that only one version can be installed at a time and during installation
it overwrite previosly installed version.

KStars NEED 64bit OS so make sure that you are running this on 64 bit Raspberry OS or alike. It will fail on 32 bit system
